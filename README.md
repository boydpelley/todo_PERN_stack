# PERN Stack Todo List
This is a project of PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, following a tutorial on Youtube. 

I created this to brush up on my PERN skills, especially with Node.js, to practice GET, PUT, and DELETE requests with React applications.

This app is a simple todo list where you can add, edit, and delete todos. 

This app utilizes Bootstrap 4 for all CSS.
